## What is KASSIBER?

**KASSIBER** is not a messenger. It is a cryptographic invisibility layer that sits *between* you and any messenger you already use.

Historically, a **Kassiber** is a secret message smuggled past guards and censorship — never going through central channels, never logged, never intercepted. This app resurrects that philosophy for the digital age to fight modern mass surveillance.

* No servers. No backend. No metadata honeypot.
* No new messenger to adopt. Works over WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, SMS, email, or even carrier pigeons.
* Post-Quantum secure today. Not tomorrow. Not "soon." **Today.**

> *The network is hostile. The cloud is someone else's computer. Your messages are yours alone.*

## The Threat Model

| Adversary | Your Defense |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Client-Side Scanning (CSS)** | **AccessibilityService Overlay** — The host messenger (and the OS scanner) only ever sees encrypted noise. |
| **Harvest Now, Decrypt Later** | **ML-KEM-768** — NIST-standardized post-quantum key encapsulation. |
| **Server Compromise** | **No server exists to compromise.** |
| **Key Extraction (Forensic)** | **StrongBox / Titan M2** — Hardware-bound keys, never leave the secure element. |
| **Metadata Analysis** | **Serverless architecture** — No routing logs, no contact graphs, no timing data. |
| **Protocol Downgrade** | **Hybrid ratchet** — SPQR + libsignal, dual-layer forward secrecy. |
| **App Tampering** | **F-Droid reproducible builds** + **AGPL-3.0** — Source is law. |

### Key Design Decisions

**Messenger-Agnostic via AccessibilityService**  
KASSIBER does not replace your messenger. It observes the screen, intercepts ciphertext in the clipboard or input field, decrypts it via a floating overlay, and encrypts outgoing messages before they reach the messenger's input field. The messenger sees only noise. The recipient sees only noise — unless they also hold the key.

**BLE Onboarding (QR → GATT)**  
No phone number verification. No email. No cloud identity. Two devices exchange ephemeral keys via Bluetooth Low Energy after a visual QR handshake. The QR contains a public key fragment; the GATT channel completes the exchange. The phone never speaks to the internet for key setup.

**Hybrid Ratchet (SPQR + libsignal)**  
Post-quantum cryptography alone is not enough. We chain ML-KEM-768's quantum resilience with libsignal's battle-tested double ratchet. Even if one layer breaks, the other holds. Forward secrecy is not optional; it is default.

---

## Post-Quantum Cryptography

KASSIBER implements the **NIST FIPS 203 / 204** standards:

* **ML-KEM-768** (Kyber) — Key Encapsulation Mechanism  
  Security level: ~192-bit classical / ~128-bit quantum  
  Ciphertext overhead: 1,088 bytes  
  Perfect for hybrid ratcheting where bandwidth matters.

* **ML-DSA-65** (Dilithium) — Digital Signature Standard  
  Security level: ~192-bit classical / ~128-bit quantum  
  Signature size: 3,293 bytes  
  Used for long-term identity signatures and build attestation.

Both primitives are implemented in **Rust** via the **pqclean** and **sphincsplus** ecosystems, compiled to Android via UniFFI with zero JNI overhead.

## Build

```shell
# Clone with submodules (Rust core is vendored for reproducibility)
git clone --recursive https://github.com/deusexlumen/KASSIBER.git
cd KASSIBER

# Build the Rust core (Android targets: arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a, x86_64)
cd rust_core
./build-android.sh # Requires Android NDK 25+, Rust 1.78+

# Build the Android app
cd ../android
./gradlew assembleRelease

# Or install directly to a connected device
./gradlew installDebug
```

### Requirements
* **Android Studio** Ladybug or newer
* **Android NDK** r25c or newer
* **Rust** 1.78+ with `cargo-ndk`
* **F-Droid build tools** (for reproducible builds)

## Distribution

<p align="center" dir="auto">
  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://f-droid.org/packages/com.deusexlumen.kassiber/">
    <img src="https://f-droid.org/badge/get-it-on.png" alt="Get it on F-Droid" height="80" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 80px;">
  </a>
</p>

**KASSIBER is exclusively distributed via F-Droid.** No Google Play. No sideloading APKs from random mirrors. No proprietary app stores.

This is not elitism. It is a security guarantee:
* **Reproducible builds** — anyone can verify the binary matches the source.
* **No proprietary tracking libraries** — no Firebase, no Crashlytics, no Play Services.
* **Update transparency** — every update is signed by F-Droid's deterministic pipeline.

**AGPL-3.0** ensures that any service built on KASSIBER — even if deployed in the cloud — must share its source. This is not just a privacy app; it is a **commons**.

---

## Why AGPL? Why F-Droid? Why no Play Store?

Because privacy is not a feature you ship. It is a **stance you take**.

* **AGPL-3.0** closes the "SaaS loophole." If someone forks KASSIBER and runs it as a backend service, they must publish their changes. The code stays free forever.
* **F-Droid** guarantees that the app you install is the app we wrote. No injected analytics, no remote configuration, no silent updates.
* **No Play Store** because Google's ecosystem requires compromising on device integrity, attestation, and user autonomy. We refuse.

> *"In a world of surveillance capitalism, writing AGPL code is an act of civil disobedience."*

## Contributing

KASSIBER is young and cryptographic. We welcome:
* **Security audits** — formal or informal. Threat model reviews are gold.
* **Rust contributions** — performance, constant-time hardening, new PQC primitives.
* **Android UX** — accessibility service reliability, overlay edge cases, battery optimization.
* **Documentation** — translations, tutorials, threat model explanations.
* **F-Droid packaging** — reproducible build expertise.

**Please read our security policy before submitting vulnerability reports.** Responsible disclosure is appreciated; public shaming is not.

## Etymology

> **Kassiber** (German Rotwelsch / Prison slang):  
> A secret message smuggled past guards or censorship.  
> Originates from the Hebrew root *k-t-b* (to write) / *kesive* (document), which entered the German language via the historical secret language of vagabonds (Rotwelsch). It represents communication that evades systemic surveillance. 

That is what this app does. It makes every message a Kassiber.
